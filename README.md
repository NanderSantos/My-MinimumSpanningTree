# My-MinimumSpanningTree

This project developed along the discipline of "Algorithms and Data Structures" at UFMG uses an implementation of the Krushkal algorithm to calculate the Minimum Spanning Tree of a graph.

The file "entrada.txt" must contain the nodes and edges of the graph as follows:

- The first line must contain the number of nodes and the number of edges of the graph

- Subsequent lines must contain the two nodes followed by the weight of the edge between them

The "saida.txt" file receives the optimized graph in the same format.

## Install

To test this library, just make a clone of this repo using the command below:

> git clone https://github.com/NanderSantos/My-MinimumSpanningTree.git

> cd My-MinimumSpanningTree

Then, just run the following command to allow the build.sh file to run:

> chmod +x build.sh

Finally run this command and everything will be done:

> ./build.sh

Or use this magical one-liner command to make it easiest:

> git clone https://github.com/NanderSantos/My-MinimumSpanningTree.git && cd My-MinimumSpanningTree && chmod +x build.sh && ./build.sh

## Run

To run the program just use the following command line below:

> ./minimum-spanning-tree entrada.txt saida.txt

To see the results of other searches, just change the input words in the consulta.txt file
