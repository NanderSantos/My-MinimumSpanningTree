# My-MinimumSpanningTree
This project developed along the discipline of "Algorithms and Data Structures" at UFMG uses an implementation of the Krushkal algorithm to calculate the Minimum Spanning Tree of a graph.  The file "entrada.txt" must contain the nodes and edges of the graph as follows:  - The first line must contain the number of nodes and the number of edges of the graph  - Subsequent lines must contain the two nodes followed by the weight of the edge between them  The "saida.txt" file receives the optimized graph in the same format.
